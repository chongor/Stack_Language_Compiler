Stack_Language_Compiler
=======================

Course Programming Project:  compiler for a stack oriented programming language written in C.

The assignment was for the creation of a compiler that uses the same calling convention that lcc does to compile J language files.

The langauge being a stack oriented programming langauge written in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).  All files were written by myself from scratch following the specifications of the assignment.

The compiler scans .j files, parses it, converts the instructions into corresponding assembly instructions, and then writes it into an outputted .asm assembly file.
